        "\n",
        "1.1 Use of try/except for error handling:\n",

I handled planning and pseudocode manually, then used AI to accelerate the translation into code, ensuring it remained within Week 4-6 lab constraints. This aligns with our lecture’s principle: humans design logic and context; AI helps execute low-level tasks.

I also applied “Defensive Programming” by validating empty inputs (if not city) before executing logic. This connected directly to my experience in doctest-based testing (Week 9)—both concepts helped ensure consistent function behavior and testability even when input was incorrect or external calls failed.\n",
